Fathoms is a datapack focused on a complex expansion of the seas of Minecraft, bringing a vast array of new mechanics, unique collectables, and macabre themes. Inspired by [Dredge](https://www.dredge.game/) as well as eldritch horror classics, it conjures an air of mystery leaving you wanting to dredge the depths for more.

# Contents
As of now, Fathoms contains:
- 56 fish found in a variety of biomes and conditions
- A complete overhaul of the fishing loot table, including a new bait system
- 2 interactive blocks to expand, diversify, and automate fishing
- A thunderous ocean mini-biome complete with shocking new hazards
- A dark ritual system, empowering you on and off the water
- A vast collection of trinkets and novelty items found at sea
- Full Peaceful mode support!
- _Countless mysteries..._
- And more!

# Note on the Wiki
As a creative decision, Fathoms' wiki will not be maintained by developers. It may contain some information provided by the community, but it is not a 100% reliable source. If you are having trouble with doing something as the wiki instructs, assume it is outdated. **All of Fathoms' content has been precisely designed to be discovered ingame via advancements, the recipe book, and diagetic clues. Additonally, Fathoms is best enjoyed blind...**

# About Compatibility
Fathoms is inherently incompatible with likely all mods and datapacks which modify the fishing loot table in any way. Compatibility is attempted with [The Creeper's Code](https://modrinth.com/datapack/the-creepers-code), but Fathoms will need to loaded after compatible packs. This can be done by running these commands in order:

`/datapack disable <Fathoms>`

`/datapack enable <Fathoms> after <Other Compatible Packs>`

Fathoms does not currently support compatibility with any other mods or datapacks in this way, and requests for such compatibility will be rejected. It is complicated, sorry.
